## 🎯 Purpose

The goal is not only to solve problems, but to build strong foundational thinking in:

- Logical reasoning
- Pattern recognition
- Complexity analysis
- Efficient problem decomposition

Data Structures & Algorithms form the base of how I approach backend and system-level problems.

## 🏗 Why This Matters

Mastering DSA strengthens my ability to:

- Design scalable backend systems
- Optimize database queries
- Improve API performance
- Handle large-scale data efficiently
- Write clean and maintainable logic

Strong fundamentals in algorithms directly impact real-world engineering quality.
